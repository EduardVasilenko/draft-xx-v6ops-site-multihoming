A survey was proposed to collect information on multi-homing solutions adopted in field deployment.
As of IETF 118 (Prague, November 4-10 2023), 17 respondents provided answers to the following questions.

Question 1: How many CPEs are connected to ISPs on the average site?
15 responses.
Answers:
  - 1.1. One CPE: 6.7%
  - 1.2. Two CPEs: 80.0%
  - 1.3. More than two: 13.3%

Question 2: How many uplinks are configured per CPEs/CEs in your average site?
15 responses.
Answers:
  - 2.1. One (every CPE has just 1 uplink toward a certain ISP): 53.3%
  - 2.2. Two or more (a CPE is connected at least with 2 different ISPs): 46.7%

Question 3: Which configuration do you support?
14 responses.
Answers:
  - 3.1. Active/active: 78.6%
  - 3.2. Active/standby: 21.4%

Question 4: Do your CPEs/CEs implement VRRP or any other dynamic exchange of redundancy control information?
15 responses.
Answers:
  - 4.1. Yes: 53.3%
  - 4.2. No: 46.7%

Question 5: If the answer to the previous is “No”, which method do you employ for supporting IPv6 multi-homing?
10 responses.
Answers:
  - 5.1. PI addressing: 40.0%
  - 5.2. PA addressing (GUA), each ISP assigns a prefix to every CPE/CE: 30.0%
  - 5.3. ULA/GUA intra-site with ALG at the border: 0.0%
  - 5.4. ULA/GUA intra-site with NPTv6 at the border: 10.0%
  - 5.5. ULA/GUA intra-site with NAT66 at the border: 10.0%
  - 5.6. Other: 10.0%
  - 5.6.1 PA addressing (GUA) with address from CPE. ULA intra-site. NAT66 at border for mismatches: 10.0%

Question 6: Which method do you employ for supporting IPv4 multi-homing (if any)?
15 responses.
Answers:
  - 6.1. Public Addressing: 53.3%
  - 6.2. NAT44: 46.7%
