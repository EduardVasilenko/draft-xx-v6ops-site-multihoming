Part of the architectures described in this document rely on different forms of translation of the source IP address of internal hosts to offer redundant carrier connectivity. It is important to point out that, while these options have been included due to having a degree of real-world deployment, they incur a large number of drawbacks unrelated to carrier redundancy which have been extensively documented.
From standards as well as practical perspectives, the [IAB request] to avoid the use of address and prefix translation has been heavily based on the long list of [NAT implications]. Some or all of the problems caused by network translation apply to the solutions in sections 5.4 and 5.5 breaking of the end-to-end model, the impossibility of initiating sessions from the outside, breaking of application-layer referrals to the addresses, single point of failure, redundancy challenges (state replication), and performance challenges (stateful processing).
The current document and its authors make no endorsement for the use of either NPTv6 or NAT66; rather, the intent is to illustrate and summarize operational alternatives currently in use when true route-based multi-homing, as exemplified by the use of PI in section 5.1, is not available.
Network administrators looking to implement multi-homing as described in sections 5.4 or 5.5 are encouraged to consider [IAB request] and [NAT implications] before making a final decision.
