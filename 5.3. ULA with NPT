[ULA] allows for the creation and use of local, non-globally registered address space that is sufficiently random to be treated like unique global addressing within a given organization or environment. However, [ULA] has notable limits concerning the number of sites that one prefix may span. Organizations requiring larger than a /48 prefix are often better served applying for and receiving a glocal PI allocation that is better sized for their needs. There may exist creative tweaks for expanding ULA, but that is outside the scope of this document. 
There is one significant details of [ULA] address space that it important to note in the presence of a dual-stacked environment, as [ULA] is prioritized below GUA and IPv4 address space on the hosts according to [SASA] section 2.1. Hence, in the dual-stack environment, it is needed to modify the [SASA] policy table to insert /48 prefix with the high precedence as recommended in section 10.6 of the [SASA]. Automation for such configuration is OS-specific, and in some cases may not be possible.
It is not mandatory to have [ULA], registered GUA (PI Addresses) may be used too, but it is the case of low probability as PI address space much more widely deployed as a routed policy directly to carriers or other upstream service providers. 
Network Prefix translation [NPT] is the unique IPv6 technology that permits a light version of NAT with 1:1 stateless relationship between addresses on the "inside" and "outside". A stateless algorithmic relationship permits to have asymmetric routing and easy redundancy if many gateways are implemented in the direction of one carrier.
Like any NAT it may create a challenge for protocols that embed IP addresses as literals for reference at the application level. It may need to use an external [STUN] server for address translation or to monitor the session by an ALG.
Additionally, protocols such as IPSec require “NAT traversal” which is typically done by encapsulation of the original session into UDP. Application support for this with IPv6 is often poor, as a main point for adoption of IPv6 is that it is no longer required and simplifies application logic. However, in practice this is not always the case and legacy applications may still operate using these techniques.
There is no need for logs because translation is algorithmic.
2/3 of Carriers lease a permanent prefix to subscribers. It would not change after the uplink re-connect. Then it is possible to initiate an inbound session from the “outside”. For other carriers, some additional efforts are needed to dynamically update DNS. Connection initiation from any direction is considered by some engineers as a value, while others value NAT one-way connectivity that is lost for NPT.
Other NAT problems are not present in NPT because it does not manipulate the transport layer.
[NPT] is partially acting against [IAB request] to preserve end-to-end transparency of the Internet which is important for the Internet's future flexibility.
Together, [ULA] and [NPT] may effectively mimic typical IPv4 carrier resilience practice: the organization could have only [ULA] inside (no GUA), and every site could have many redundant connections through the separate [NPT] engines on every gateway to carriers.
There is a principal difference from the typical IPv4 NAT solution that [NPT] needs an equal prefix size from “inside” and “outside”. It is typically possible to get /56 or /60 from the fixed broadband carrier, but it is significantly less common to be delegated more than /64 from the mobile carrier because DHCP is typically blocked on mobile modems. Hence, if the carrier is mobile then only a simplified site with one internal /64 subnet is practical.
For fast convergence, routers should announce “default” on-site and may additionally announce some more specific prefixes if needed. Additional destination prefixes permit traffic distribution policy between carriers.
In the case of transit internal routing hops, such announcements probably need routing.
In the case of the link for the respective host (last hop), such an announcement is the default router status in [ND] or [Route Preferences] for the more specific routes. The last one is mandatory to access the “subscriber-only services”.
The principal requirement is that routers should trace connectivity to carriers to deprecate “default” and more specific announcements when needed.
Advantages:
-	No need for official address space, the ULA prefix is a random self-generated,
-	Easy to implement, the same practice as for the current IPv4 carrier resiliency,
-	Possibility for traffic distribution policy between different carriers, but without the possibility to access a filtered resource (“subscriber-only services”).
Disadvantages:
-	Challenge to automate ULA prioritization on hosts above IPv4,
-	NPT breaks some applications with address referrals at the application level, some additional solutions are needed (STUN, ALG),
-	Custom distribution policies needed for access to filtered resource (“subscriber-only services”),
-	Session initiation from the outside is practical only for cases when the carrier prefix is stable or DNS is dynamically updated,
-	Currently limited to one subnet per site in the mobile environment,
-	May hinder overall IPv6 adoption as IPv6 with NPT lose ent-to-end connectivity advantage,
-	For applications similar to ULA with NAT66 (section 5.4).
