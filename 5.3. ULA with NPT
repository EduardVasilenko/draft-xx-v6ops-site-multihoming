[ULA] allows for the creation and use of local, non-globally reachable and not centrally assigned address space that is sufficiently random to be treated like globally-unique addressing within a given organization or environment. However, [ULA] has notable limits concerning the number of sites that one prefix may span, and well documented usability limitations when considering address selection details across large, diverse network environments. 
Organizations requiring larger than a /48 prefix are often better served applying for and receiving a global PI allocation that is right-sized for their needs. There may exist creative tweaks for expanding ULA beyond its normal size, but that is outside the scope of this document.
There is also one significant detail of [ULA] address space that is important to note in the presence of a dual-stacked environment, as [ULA] is prioritized below GUA and IPv4 address space on the hosts according to [SASA] section 2.1. Hence, in a dual-stack environment, it is necessary to modify the [SASA] policy table to insert the /48 prefix with higher precedence, as recommended in section 10.6 of [SASA]. Automation for such configuration is OS-specific, and in some cases may not be possible.
It is not mandatory to have [ULA] for the solution described in this section, registered GUA (PI addresses in particular) may be used too, but this has a low chance of happening as PI address space is much more widely deployed as a routed policy directly to carriers or other upstream service providers.
Network Prefix translation [NPT] is the unique IPv6 technology that enables a lightweight version of NAT with a 1:1 stateless relationship between addresses on the "inside" and "outside". A stateless algorithmic relationship permits to have asymmetric routing and easy redundancy if multiple gateways are implemented facing a single carrier.
Like any NAT it may create a challenge for protocols that embed IP addresses at the application level. It may require the usage of an external [STUN] server for address translation, or monitoring of the session by an ALG.
Additionally, when crossing NAT environments, protocols such as IPSec require or fallback to “NAT traversal” schemes, which typically work by encapsulating the original session into UDP. Application support for this with IPv6 is often poor because a main talking point for the adoption of IPv6 is that “NAT traversal” is no longer required and that this simplifies the application logic. However, in practice, this is not always the case and legacy applications may still require these techniques to operate.
Contrary to other forms of NAT, with NPT there is no need to generate or retain translation logs because translation is stateless and deterministic.
Two-thirds of carriers lease a permanent prefix to subscribers, and such prefix would thus remain the same after the uplink is disconnected and re-connected. For this reason, it is possible to initiate an inbound session from the “outside” in a stable and continuous manner; the NPT engine is able to apply the required translation on all outbound and inbound packets regardless of whether they are part of a new or existing connection. For other carriers which do not lease prefixes permanently, some additional efforts are needed to dynamically update DNS records, and use those to establish inbound connections. The possibility of connection initiation in any direction (when firewall rules allow it) is considered valuable by some engineers, while others value the one-way connectivity typical of NAT that is lost with NPT.
Similarly, other NAT-related problems are not present with NPT because it does not require manipulation of the transport layer.
[NPT] is partially acting against the [IAB request] to preserve the end-to-end transparency of the Internet which is important for the Internet's future flexibility.
Together, [ULA] and [NPT] may effectively mimic the typical IPv4 carrier resilience practices: the organization might only have [ULA] inside its network (no GUA), and every site could have many redundant connections through separate [NPT] engines on every border gateway, making use of the actual PA space provided by each carrier on the external side of the translation to enable global reachability towards Internet destinations.
There is, however, a principal difference from the typical IPv4 NAT solution in that [NPT] needs an equally-sized prefix on the “inside” and “outside”. While it is typically possible to get a /56 or /60 from the fixed broadband carrier, it is significantly less common to be delegated more than a /64 by the mobile carrier; hence, if the carrier is mobile then only a simplified site with one internal /64 subnet is feasible.
For faster convergence, routers should announce a “default” on-site and then additionally some more specific prefixes if needed. Additional destination prefixes facilitate the distribution of traffic between the carriers.
In cases where internal routing hops are present between the edge devices, such announcements likely require other protocols in addition to Neighbor Discovery.
As for the network interface of the internal host (the last hop), such an announcement comes in the form of default router status in [ND], and [Route Preferences] for the more specific routes. The last one in particular is essential to be able to access “subscriber-only services”.
The crucial requirement remains that routers must continuously track connectivity to carriers to be able to deprecate the “default” as well as any more specific announcements when such connectivity is lost.
Advantages:
-	No need for official address space, the ULA prefix is pseudo-randomly self-generated,
-	Easy to implement, similar in practice to current IPv4 carrier resiliency techniques,
-	Potential for traffic distribution policy between different carriers.
Disadvantages:
-	It is challenging to automate ULA prioritization above IPv4 on hosts,
-	NPT breaks some applications with address referrals at the application level, some additional solutions are needed (STUN, ALG),
-	Custom distribution policies are needed for access to filtered resources (“subscriber-only services”),
-	Session initiation from the outside is practical only in cases where the carrier prefix is stable or DNS records are dynamically updated,
-	Currently limited to one subnet per site in mobile environments,
-	May hinder overall IPv6 adoption as IPv6 with NPT loses the end-to-end connectivity advantage,
-	For applications, the drawbacks are similar to ULA with NAT66 (section 5.4).
