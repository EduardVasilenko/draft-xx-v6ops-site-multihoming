[ULA] permits to have local non-registered address space that is sufficiently random to be treated like unique global. [ULA] is global concerning the number of sites that one prefix may span. /48 prefix permits to have 64k of normal subnets (/64) which may be enough for many organizations. The bigger organizations would probably get registered GUA addresses anyway.
There is one nuance that [ULA] address space is prioritized below GUA and IPv4 address space on the hosts according to [SASA] section 2.1. Hence, in the dual-stack environment, it is needed to modify the [SASA] policy table to insert /48 prefix with the high precedence as recommended in section 10.6 of the [SASA]. Automation for such configuration is OS-specific.
It is not mandatory to have [ULA], registered GUA (PI Addresses) may be used too, but it is the case of low probability because PI address space is much better to route directly to carriers. However a carrier may not support this or charge significantly more.
Network Prefix translation [NPT] is the unique IPv6 technology that permits a light version of NAT with 1:1 stateless relationship between addresses on the "inside" and "outside". A stateless algorithmic relationship permits to have asymmetric routing and easy redundancy if many gateways are implemented in the direction of one carrier.
Like any NAT it may create a challenge for protocols that embed IP addresses (for references) at the application level. It may need to use an external [STUN] server for address translation or to monitor the session by ALG.
Additionally, IPSec needs “NAT traversal” which is typically done by encapsulation of the original session into UDP. Application support for this with IPv6 is often poor, as a main point for adoption of IPv6 is that it is no longer required and simplifies application logic.
There is no need for logs because translation is algorithmic.
It is possible to initiate the session from the “outside” with the probability 2/3 when the carrier prefix is permanent (would not change after uplink re-connect) or some additional efforts are needed to dynamically update DNS. Connection initiation from any direction is considered by some engineers as a value, while others value NAT one-way connectivity that is lost for NPT.
Other NAT problems are not present in NPT because it does not manipulate the transport layer.
[NPT] is partially acting against [IAB request] to preserve end-to-end transparency of the Internet which is important for the Internet's future flexibility.
Together, [ULA] and [NPT] may effectively mimic typical IPv4 carrier resilience practice: the organization could have only [ULA] inside (no GUA), and every site could have many redundant connections through the separate [NPT] engines on every gateway to carriers.
There is a principal difference from the typical IPv4 NAT solution that [NPT] needs an equal prefix size from “inside” and “outside”. It is typically possible to get /56 or /60 from the fixed broadband carrier, but it is typically not possible to get more than /64 from the mobile carrier because DHCP is blocked on mobile modems. Hence, if the carrier is mobile then only a simplified site with one internal /64 subnet is practical.
For fast convergence, routers should announce “default” on-site and may additionally announce some more specific prefixes if needed. Additional destination prefixes permit traffic distribution policy between carriers.
In the case of transit internal routing hops, such announcements probably need routing.
In the case of the link for the respective host (last hop), such an announcement is the default router status in [ND] or [Route Preferences] for the more specific routes. The last one is mandatory to access the “subscriber-only services”.
The principal requirement is that routers should trace connectivity to carriers to deprecate “default” and more specific announcements when needed.
Advantages:
-	No need for official address space,
the ULA prefix is a random self-generated,
-	Easy to implement,
the same practice as for the current IPv4 carrier resiliency,
-	Possibility for traffic distribution policy between different carriers, but without the possibility to access a filtered resource (“subscriber-only services”).
Disadvantages:
-	Challenge to automate ULA prioritization on hosts above IPv4,
-	NPT breaks some applications with address referrals at the application level,
some additional solutions are needed (STUN, ALG),
-	Session initiation from the outside is practical only for cases when the carrier prefix is stable or DNS is dynamically updated,
-	Currently limited to one subnet per site in the mobile environment,
-	May hinder overall IPv6 adoption,
-	For applications similar to ULA with NAT66 (section 5.4).
