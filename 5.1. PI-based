The company could easily buy /48 Provider Independent GUA prefix from RIR or LIR. The much bigger prefix is possible with a little additional effort. Anyway, not all companies are ready for this activity.
PI prefix permits the creation of an address plan that would never need renumbering. Hence, the plan may be stable enough to be manually provisioned over all routers and links even in the complex topology.
The convergence of this solution is excellent because there is no need for renumbering, it is just a normal routing update with default routing status withdrawal for the router that lost internet connectivity.
It may be a small problem to route the PI prefix by the carrier because such client attachment type is typically charged more by the carrier. It typically needs a manual procedure on the carrier side, hence, it is not possible to bypass the carrier’s help.
For fast convergence, routers should announce “default” on-site and may additionally announce some more specific prefixes if needed. Additional destination prefixes permit traffic distribution policy between carriers.
In the case of transit internal routing hops, such announcements probably need routing.
In the case of the link for the respective host (last hop), such an announcement is the default router status in [ND] or [Route Preferences] for the more specific routes.
The principal requirement is that routers should trace connectivity to carriers to deprecate “default” and more specific announcements when needed.
In the PI-based solution there are multiple entry points into the local network for traffic destined to every single address in the site, and this opens up discussion on how to load balance incoming traffic to such a site. It is possible to split the prefix into many smaller prefixes and announce them separately to different Carriers. It needs the initial prefix to be big enough because if split prefixes would be smaller than /48 then they would be filtered out of the Internet. Big companies are using it already, small companies would probably never need it. This advanced incoming traffic engineering is possible only for PI prefixes.
Where the choice of path for return traffic is crucial, such as in environments performing application-based traffic steering, PI can fail to meet the requirements for traffic symmetry. While traffic engineering using routing advertisements can provide benefits for simple active/passive connectivity requirements, it can be insufficient; routing advertisements are not granular or fast enough to make things work in scenarios where different application traffic must be steered towards different uplinks. As an example, an administrator might need FTP traffic generated by an internal host to exit through the secondary Internet link, and for the return traffic to also arrive back on that same link; allowing the downstream component of the FTP connection to occupy bandwidth on the primary link might in fact be undesirable, and impact the performance of more sensitive protocols running over the primary link. Even in the extreme case where /128 prefixes for the internal host were advertised, engineering different return paths based on upper-layer information would not be feasible in a deterministic manner for the same source address.
In addition, environments where the edge devices (commonly, perimeter firewalls) are stateful might experience packet drops due to TCP session flows being split across Internet links. This would be especially true in the case where multiple stateful devices were deployed, one for each Internet link; the devices would thus only see a portion of the TCP sessions and never consider them fully established, or miss enough segments that the next arriving sequence number might be considered out of window, from their standpoint. Both conditions could cause the devices to drop segments. Note that these symptoms would be exaggerated for TCP traffic but also possible with other protocols such as UDP, if the stateful devices had a way to track the sessions and only allowed inbound UDP traffic when a matching tuple already existed in its session table.
The primary problem with PI addresses is that the widespread practice to use PI addresses would bloat the Internet routing table at least 10 times which would greatly impact the cost and scalability of all Internet routers. Albeit, this problem is not a concern of a company implementing a PI-based solution.
Advantages:
-	Preserve end-to-end communication,
-	Do not request any functionality from the host,
-	Straightforward design,
-	Allows aggregation of multiple uplinks for increased throughput,
-	Support sites with complex topology.
-	Seamless link failover without transport session re-establishment
-	Support outbound traffic steering
Disadvantages:
-	Hard to implement esp. for smaller entities as it requires knowledge of advanced routing protocols like BGP and advanced networking hardware (It is not as simple as plugging two independent CPEs into the same switch as the clients and have it work),
-	In case of provider failure, a prefix may not be correctly deprecated from global routing and lead to complex error scenarios and downtime,
-	Need to pay and liaise with RIR or LIR (for the PI address space),
-	Need carriers to accept PI prefix advertisements,
carriers typically charge significantly more for such type of attachment. Often SD-WAN contracts are required instead of business DSL contracts,
-	Return traffic path not guaranteed to mirror the outbound path
-	Blow Internet routing table.
