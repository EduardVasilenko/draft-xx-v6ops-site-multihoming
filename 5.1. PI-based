While building or expanding an IPv6 addressing plan, it may become necessary for an organization to procure or acquire additional network resources; it is reasonably straightforward to obtain additional Provider-Independent GUA address space and ASN from an RIR or LIR. However, not all organizations have the in-house expertise, desire, or capability to execute such a plan.
PI prefixes allow the creation of an address plan that would never need renumbering, due to the non-dynamic and non-conditional nature of the prefix allocation. Hence, the address plan may be stable enough to be manually provisioned over all routers and links even in a complex topology.
The long-term supportability and network convergence time of this solution are excellent because there is no need for renumbering; losing one of the Internet connectivities simply implies normal routing updates with default routing status withdrawal by the affected router.
It may, however, be a more involved process to get the PI prefix routed by the carrier because such type of customer attachment is typically charged more by the carrier due to the more complicated nature of the connection and configuration (i.e. dynamic protocol configuration, configuration of appropriate prefix filtering, and equipment to support the necessary protocols). It generally requires a manual procedure on the carrier's side, and hence it is not possible to set this up without their cooperation.
For faster convergence, routers should announce a “default” on-site and then add some more specific prefixes if needed. Additional destination prefixes facilitate the distribution of traffic between the carriers.
In cases where internal routing hops are present between the edge devices, such announcements likely require other protocols in addition to Neighbor Discovery.
As for the network interface of the internal host (the last hop), such an announcement comes in the form of default router status in [ND], and [Route Preferences] for the more specific routes.
The crucial requirement in the PI-based solution is that routers have to continuously track connectivity to carriers to be able to deprecate the “default” as well as any more specific announcements when such connectivity is lost.
When multi-homing with PI space there are multiple entry points into the local network for traffic destined to every single address in the site, and this opens up discussion on how to load balance incoming traffic to such a site. An example can split the prefix into many smaller prefixes and announce them separately to different carriers. This requires that the initial prefix is of adequate size, to avoid ending up with announcements smaller than the longest acceptable prefix length within the default-free zone, which is conventionally /48. This advanced incoming traffic engineering is possible only with PI address space.
Where traffic symmetry over the WAN is important, however, such as in environments performing application-based traffic steering, PI can fail to guarantee the necessary control over returning traffic. Traffic engineering using routing advertisements provides benefits for simple active/passive or active/active connectivity needs, but it can also be insufficient; routing advertisements are not granular or fast enough to make things work in scenarios where different application traffic must be steered towards different uplinks based on upper-layer information. As an example, an administrator might need FTP traffic generated by an internal host to always exit through the secondary Internet link, and for the return traffic to also arrive back on that same link; allowing the downstream component of FTP connections to occupy bandwidth on the primary link might be undesirable, and impact the performance of more sensitive protocols running over the primary link. Even in the extreme case where /128 prefixes for the internal host were advertised, engineering different return paths based on upper-layer information would not be feasible in a deterministic manner for the same source address.
In addition, environments, where the edge devices (commonly, perimeter firewalls) are stateful might experience packet drops due to TCP session flows being split across Internet links. This would be especially true in the case where multiple stateful devices were deployed, one for each Internet link; the devices would thus only see a portion of the TCP sessions and never consider them fully established, or miss enough segments that the next arriving sequence number might be considered out of the window from their standpoint. Both conditions could cause the devices to drop segments. Note that these symptoms would be exaggerated for TCP traffic but also possible with other protocols such as UDP, if the stateful devices had a way to track the sessions and allowed inbound UDP traffic only when a matching tuple already existed in their session tables.
On the other hand, a crucial advantage of using a prefix that is globally reachable through multiple Internet links is the seamless failover of transport-layer sessions across the links without having to re-establish them. Conventionally, in IPv4 environments, such a failover would have been guaranteed to break existing communication due to the ubiquity of PA addressing combined with NAT44, and the consequent change in source address as seen by the remote endpoint. This issue would also be felt when leveraging IPv6 multi-homing in a way that caused source address changes upon failover, either due to NAT (see sections 5.3 and 5.4) or the prefix of the existing connection becoming unusable (see section 5.2).
The biggest problem with PI addresses today remains the fact that the widespread practice of using PI space would bloat the Internet routing table by at least 10 times (reaching up to 10M entries in the default-free zone), which would greatly impact the cost and scalability of Internet routers. Admittedly, however, this problem would not be an immediate concern for any enterprise company implementing a PI-based solution.
The implementation of RPKI (for prefix ownership protection) is also among the additional challenges that enterprises making use of PI may face in the future, requiring skilled personnel to the setup and operation of BGP.
Advantages:
-	Preserves end-to-end communication,
-	Does not require any special functionality from the host,
-	Straightforward design,
-	Allows aggregation of multiple uplinks for increased throughput,
-	Supports sites with complex topology,
-	Seamless link failover without transport session re-establishment,
-	Supports outbound traffic steering.
Disadvantages:
-	Hard to implement especially for smaller entities, as it requires knowledge of advanced routing protocols like BGP and availability of advanced networking hardware (it is not as simple as plugging two independent CPEs into the same switch as the client and having it work); moreover, skills related to RPKI may be needed in the future,
-	In case of provider failure a prefix may not be correctly deprecated from global routing, and this could lead to complex error scenarios and downtime,
-	The need to pay and liaise with a RIR or LIR for the PI address space,
-	Needs carriers to accept PI prefix advertisements,
- Carriers typically charge significantly more for such type of attachment; often SD-WAN contracts are required instead of business DSL contracts,
-	The return traffic path is not guaranteed to mirror the outbound path,
-	Bloats the Internet routing table with a potential 10 million new routes.
