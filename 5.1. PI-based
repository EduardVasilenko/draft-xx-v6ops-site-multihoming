The company could easily buy /48 Provider Independent GUA prefix from RIR or LIR. The much bigger prefix is possible with a little additional effort. Anyway, not all companies are ready for this activity.
PI prefix permits the creation of an address plan that would never need renumbering. Hence, the plan may be stable enough to be manually provisioned over all routers and links even in the complex topology.
The convergence of this solution is excellent because there is no need for renumbering, it is just a normal routing update with default routing status withdrawal for the router that lost internet connectivity.
It may be a small problem to route the PI prefix by the carrier because such client attachment type is typically charged more by the carrier. It typically needs a manual procedure on the carrier side, hence, it is not possible to bypass the carrier’s help.
For fast convergence, routers should announce “default” on-site and may additionally announce some more specific prefixes if needed. Additional destination prefixes permit traffic distribution policy between carriers.
In the case of transit internal routing hops, such announcements probably need routing.
In the case of the link for the respective host (last hop), such an announcement is the default router status in [ND] or [Route Preferences] for the more specific routes.
The principal requirement is that routers should trace connectivity to carriers to deprecate “default” and more specific announcements when needed.
Let’s put aside the discussion on how to load balance incoming traffic to such a site. It is possible to split the prefix into many smaller prefixes and announce them separately to different Carriers. It needs the initial prefix to be big enough because if split prefixes would be smaller than /48 then they would be filtered out of the Internet. Big companies are using it already, small companies would probably never need it. This advanced incoming traffic engineering is possible only for PI prefixes.
The primary problem with PI addresses is that the widespread practice to use PI addresses would bloat the Internet routing table at least 10 times which would greatly impact the cost and scalability of all Internet routers. Albeit, this problem is not a concern of a company implementing a PI-based solution.
Advantages:
-	Preserve end-to-end communication,
-	Do not request any functionality from the host,
-	Straightforward design,
-	Allows aggregation of multiple uplinks for increased throughput,
-	Support sites with complex topology.
Disadvantages:
-	Hard to implement esp. for smaller entities as it requires knowledge of advanced routing protocols like BGP and advanced networking hardware (It is not as simple as plugging two independent CPEs into the same switch as the clients and have it work),
-	In case of provider failure, a prefix may not be correctly deprecated from global routing and lead to complex error scenarios and downtime,
-	Need to pay and liaise with RIR or LIR (for the PI address space),
-	Need carriers to accept PI prefix advertisements,
carriers typically charge significantly more for such type of attachment. Often SD-WAN contracts are required instead of business DSL contracts,
-	Blow Internet routing table.
