Not all requirements are possible to achieve for all solutions:

The table above shows partial support of end-to-end connectivity for the ULA+NPT solution because it permits initiating connectivity in any direction but address references in the application layer would need special treatment like ALG or [STUN].
Internal connectivity is marked as partial support for the reason of the complexity needed to promote ULA address space above IPv4.
Convergence speed is partially acceptable by a PA-based solution because [HNCP] or DHCP-PD has not been adopted by the market but it is needed for prefix deprecation propagation over a complex site.
Complex topology is partially supported by the ULA+NPT solution because it is not possible (on real products) to get bigger than /64 external prefix in the mobile environment.
Support for the “subscriber-only services” is marked as partial because it needs a routing announcement as “Routing Information Options” of [Route Preferences] which is not widely supported.
Traffic steering on routers is marked as partially supported for PI-based solution because of the high complexity to organize incoming traffic steering. NAT/NPT-based solutions connect ingress traffic steering to egress which makes it simple.
Some functionality reflected in the table above may be improved but the roadmap (active IETF draft) is not available at the time of this writing.
Theoretically, just from the technical point of view, the solutions are ordered in section 5. PI is the best, PA-based is more complex, and, NPT breaks end-to-end Internet model, and so on. Practically, the company could have non-technical requirements that override technical ones. The table above is not complete – it should be augmented by non-technical requirements that are perceived by the network owner.

For many network owners, the principal ramification point may be the desire to have end-to-end connectivity because it is the big advantage of IPv6. This question may be especially important for resources that should be exposed to the Internet.
If it is needed then PI or PA –based solutions are applicable.
Then the acceptance of the additional challenges is needed:
•	to get a PI prefix from RIR or LIR,
•	to pay a premium for PI advertisements by carriers (carriers often impose different tariff plans for such an attachment circuit).
If both challenges are acceptable then the PI-based solution is the best: simple, reliable, and scalable. The burden that the PI-based solution would create on the Internet infrastructure is probably not the concern of the small organization investigating carrier resilience.
If at least one challenge above is not acceptable then the PA-based solution needs to be implemented with all restrictions and complexities discussed in section 5.2. For the exception when complex site support is needed in a mobile environment.
Let’s return to our primary question about the need for end-to-end connectivity to answer it negatively.
Then ULA+NPT solution (discussed in section 5.3) is better in many situations except the case when NAT66 is a strict non-technical requirement or the site is complex with mobile connectivity as a backup.

It could be the situation when the site has a complex topology (many links and routers) then a PA-based solution is not an option yet because it would need automatic PA addresses distribution over the site but [HNCP] or DHCP-PD has not gained market acceptance for this scenario.
Then the logic would be like the above but after the PI evaluation, the next option would be ULA+NPT.

The simplicity of the PI-based solution or perceived NAT66 regulatory requirements may be the primary factor then the logic may be different.
For different design goals, it is possible to get the rough consultancy from the table above for supported requirements.
It is recommended to read section 5. for fine-tuning the custom prioritization graph.
