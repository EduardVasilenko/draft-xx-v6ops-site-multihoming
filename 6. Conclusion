Not all requirements can be satisfied by every solution:

The table above shows partial support for end-to-end connectivity for the ULA+NPT solution because, while it does allow initiating connectivity in any direction, employing address references at the application layer requires extra steps, for example in the form of an ALG or [STUN].
Internal connectivity is marked as partial support due to the complexity involved in promoting the ULA address space above IPv4 in the [SASA] policy table of hosts.
Convergence speed is partially satisfied by the PA-based solution because [HNCP] or DHCP-PD have not been adopted by the market, and they would be needed for prefix deprecation propagation over a complex site.
Complex topology support is marked as partially satisfied by the ULA+NPT solution because it is not possible in practice to get an external prefix larger than /64 from mobile carriers.
Support for “subscriber-only services” is marked as partial because it needs a routing announcement as a “Routing Information Option” of [Route Preferences], which is not widely supported.
Traffic steering on routers is marked as partially supported for the PI-based solution because of the high complexity involved in organizing the steering of incoming traffic. NAT/NPT-based solutions connect ingress traffic steering to egress which makes them simpler in this regard.
Some of the functionality reflected in the table above may be improved in the future, but a roadmap (active IETF draft) is not available at the time of writing.
Theoretically, from a purely technical point of view, the solutions in section 5 are ordered by the amount of requirements satisfied, from most to least: PI is the best, PA-based is more complex, NPT breaks the end-to-end Internet model, and so on. In the real world, though, the company could have non-technical requirements that override the technical ones. The table above is not complete – it should be enriched with non-technical requirements as perceived by the network owner.

For many network owners, the main deciding factor may be the desire to have end-to-end connectivity, as it is the most notable advantage of deploying IPv6 compared to IPv4. This may be especially important when managing resources that need to be exposed to the Internet.
If this is needed then PI or PA–based solutions are applicable, and network owners must undertake some additional steps to implement them:
•	obtain a PI prefix from a RIR or LIR,
•	pay a premium for advertisement of the PI prefixes through the carriers (as these often impose different tariffs for such an attachment circuit).
If both of these challenges are deemed acceptable then the PI-based solution is preferrable: simple, reliable, and scalable. The universal adoption of PI by companies of all sizes would create a burden for Internet routing, but this issue is unlikely to be considered a priority by an organization whose decision-making process is already constrained by many other factors.
If at least one of the aforementioned challenges is not acceptable then PA may be the solution of choice, even with all the restrictions and complexities discussed in section 5.2. A notable exception to this is if complex topology support is a requirement and the site is served by a mobile carrier (due to the unavailability of prefixes larger than /64 on such connections).
It may also be the case that end-to-end connectivity is not a necessity, and may even be undesired. Here, the ULA+NPT solution (discussed in section 5.3) satisfies a greater amount of requirements in the majority of situations, apart from cases where NAT66 is a strict (non-technical) requirement or the site has a combination of complex topology and mobile connectivity (problematic due to the small assignments on the WAN side and the 1:1 mechanism of NPT.)

For sites having a complex topology (many links and routers) a PA-based solution is not an option yet, because it would need automatic PA address distribution over the site and neither [HNCP] nor DHCP-PD have gained market acceptance for this task.
The logical steps in the design process would then be like the ones above, but after having evaluated the PI-based solution the next option would be ULA+NPT.

Previous availability of PI space, or perceived NAT66 regulatory requirements might also be primary factors, and then the logic may yet again be different.
For further use-cases that have not been discusses in this document, it is possible to get a general expectation of compatibility using the table above.
It is however recommended to read section 5. to fine-tune the custom requirements matrix and grade each solution accordingly.
