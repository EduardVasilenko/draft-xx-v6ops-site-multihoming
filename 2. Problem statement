Always-on connectivity is a key requirement for the vast majority of businesses. [IAB report] predicts “might be as many as 10 million multihomed sites by 2050”. Unfortunately, several issues may affect the connection of a business to its upstream service provider. For example, the carrier’s network, the network gateway, or the connection link may go down. It is especially true now after many recent examples of massive carrier outages.
A redundant connection to the carrier is then the norm for business.
A simple topology that discusses this key requirement is shown in figure 1. Note that the topology could be more complex as shown, for example, in figure 3 [MHMP Enterprise].

   Figure 1: The basic Carrier Resiliency topology
Without entering too much into the details, resilience is generally achieved by employing redundant elements. Two Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) systems are usually employed. Very often, each CPE connects the business to a different carrier. In some cases, a CPE may even connect to two different carriers, to achieve a higher level of protection against network failures.
In literature, a topology such as that shown in figure 1 based on IPv6 connectivity is often referred to as Multi-Home, Multi-Prefix (MHMP). The name implies that a business is multi-homed to different carriers, receiving from them different network prefixes.
The problem of providing network protection with IPv6 was thoroughly discussed in [Local Protection]. This document is a refreshment and an attempt to give practical recommendations.
IPv4 is solving such a scenario by independent NAT translation on every CPE to the carrier in combination with private address space on site. [Local Protection] has a good list of benefits. The solution was initially adopted for the shortage of address space. Later, security benefits and carrier resiliency have been spotted. Many people are so accustomed to the NAT solution that demands it rigorously without discussing alternative options.
[Local Protection] has a list of IPv6 tools that replace all functionality of the NAT solution except address conservation which is not needed in IPv6. Time has shown that all IPv6 tools have been accepted as valid replacements except IPv6 “multihoming and renumbering”. The discussion about the last problem continues up to now.
The approaches currently available to address local protection and, more specifically, the multi-homing and renumbering issue is the subject of this analysis, and are listed hereafter.
There are 4 potential possible solutions:
-	Static PI address space for the site that is routed by Carriers,
-	Dynamic PA addresses distribution and withdrawal from Carriers,
-	Static ULA address space for the site with NPT translation,
-	Static ULA address space for the site with NAT translation.
The simplest solution is to have Provider Independent (PI) addresses on-site with proper routing announcements by carriers on behalf of the client. It does not have a big discussion history because the solution was always stable and simple. The solution has challenges that prevent it from becoming universal and widespread. It would be discussed in section 5.1. 
A widespread approach sees a [IPv6] host have many IPv6 addresses on the link(s). These addresses may be Provider Aggregatable (PA) from different carriers. In this typical scenario, the host has the challenge of properly choosing the combination of 1) a source address that would be not filtered from the particular resource on the Internet, and 2) a next-hop that is leading to the source address owner who would not filter the packet.
This host-driven solution is primarily based on the interaction of [ND] and [SASA]. Routers should supply all needed information then the host should choose the proper combination of the source address and next hop for any destination address that the host would like to communicate.
Further challenges may make this scenario even more complex. In particular, the site may have a multi-hop topology (many links and routers). In such a case, the decision taken by the host on how to deliver traffic to the carrier that has assigned the source address needs to be complemented with source routing. This source-routing problem is properly discussed in [MHMP Enterprise].
An additional challenge is posed by DNS. If the host has separate interfaces then it is possible to have a separate DNS resolver for every interface. 
[Provisioning domains] is needed when the single router has many upstream carriers. [Provisioning domains] allows associating the prefix used to select the source address with the proper DNS resolver, otherwise, the packet might be delivered to the wrong carrier (and then filtered out). 
The host-driven solution is complex (involves [ND], [SASA], Source routing, and DNS), hence, it has a long history of improvements and debates and it is extensively discussed in section 5.2.
Other available solutions see the use of [NPT] and NAT66 in combination with Unique Local Addresses (ULA).  The IETF consensus to preserve end-to-end connectivity does not favor the general acceptance of these two solutions, yet they are described in sections 5.3 and 5.4 because they offer a degree of support for the requirements listed in section 4.
