Always-on connectivity is a key requirement for the vast majority of businesses. [IAB report] predicts that there “might be as many as 10 million multihomed sites by 2050”. Unfortunately, several issues may affect the connection of a business to its upstream service provider. For example, the carrier’s network, the network gateway, or the first-mile infrastructure may experience issues. It is especially true now after many recent examples of massive carrier outages.
A redundant connection to the carrier is then the norm for business.
A simple topology that showcases this key requirement is shown in figure 1. Note that the topology could be more complex as shown, for example, in figure 3 [MHMP Enterprise].

   Figure 1: The basic Carrier Resiliency topology
Without entering too much into details, resilience is generally achieved by employing redundant elements. Two Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) systems are usually employed. Very often, each CPE connects the business to a different carrier. In some cases, a CPE may even connect to two different carriers, to achieve a higher level of protection against network failures.
In literature, a topology such as that shown in figure 1 based on IPv6 connectivity is often referred to as Multi-Home, Multi-Prefix (MHMP). The name implies that a network is multi-homed to different carriers, receiving from them different network prefixes.
The problem of providing network protection with IPv6 was thoroughly discussed in [Local Protection]. This document is an overview of the most commonly used methods to facilitate the desired protection in modern IPv6 networks, along with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
In IPv4 environments, such a scenario is implemented through independent NAT translation on every CPE to the carrier in combination with private address space on-site. [Local Protection] has a good list of benefits. The solution was initially adopted due the shortage of globally-reachable address space. Later, security and carrier resiliency were identified as additional benefits. Due to the prevalence of a solution based around address translation in IPv4, demands are often voiced for such a mechanism in IPv6 as well, running the risk of being chosen by network designers without evaluating alternative options.
[Local Protection] has a list of IPv6 tools that replace all functionality of the NAT solution except address conservation, which is not a necessity in IPv6. Time has shown that all IPv6 tools have been accepted as valid replacements except IPv6 “multihoming and renumbering”. Discussions about this last problem are ongoing.
The approaches currently available to address local protection and, more specifically, the multi-homing and renumbering issue are the subject of this analysis, and are listed hereafter.
There are 4 potential possible solutions:
-	Static PI address space for the site, routed by multiple carriers,
-	Dynamic PA addresses distribution and withdrawal from carriers,
-	Static ULA address space for the site with NPT translation,
-	Static ULA address space for the site with NAT66 translation.
The simplest solution is to have Provider Independent (PI) addresses on-site with proper routing announcements by carriers on behalf of the client. This method does not have a significant discussion history because the solution was always stable and simple. The solution has challenges that prevent it from becoming universal and widespread. It will be discussed in section 5.1.
A widespread approach sees an [IPv6] host have many IPv6 addresses on its link(s). These addresses may be Provider Aggregatable (PA) from different carriers. In this typical scenario, the host has the challenge of properly choosing the combination of 1) a source address that would be not filtered from the particular resource on the Internet, and 2) a next-hop that is leading to the source address owner who would not filter the packet.
This host-driven solution is primarily based on the interaction of [ND] and [SASA]. Routers should supply all needed information, and then the host should choose the proper combination of source address and next-hop for any destination address that the host would like to communicate with.
Further challenges may make this scenario even more complex. In particular, the site may have a multi-hop topology (many links and routers). In such a case, the decision taken by the host on how to deliver traffic to the carrier that has assigned the source address needs to be complemented with source routing. This source-routing problem is properly discussed in [MHMP Enterprise].
In the subset of scenarios where the path for return traffic is required to be symmetric, such as when performing application-based traffic steering, the issue is further complicated. It has become common in enterprise networks to steer traffic from a host in the internal network to exit via different Internet uplinks based on transport and application-layer information, instead of only the network characteristics of packets. The edge gateway can in this case perform complex forwarding decisions based on a policy table and deep-packet inspection, but routers on the Internet do not share the same list of policies and are thus unable to guarantee the same path for returning packets in a given flow. Similar mechanisms have until today relied on IPv4 PA addressing combined with NAT44 to guarantee flow symmetry and centralize the decision-making process when selecting which carrier to deliver the traffic to.
An additional challenge is posed by DNS. If the host has separate interfaces then it is possible to have a separate DNS resolver for every interface. 
[Provisioning domains] is needed when the single router has many upstream carriers. [Provisioning domains] allows associating the prefix used to select the source address with the proper DNS resolver, otherwise, the packet might be delivered to the wrong carrier (and then filtered out). 
The host-driven solution is complex (involves [ND], [SASA], Source routing, and DNS), hence, it has a long history of improvements and debates and it is extensively discussed in section 5.2.

Other available solutions see the use of [NPT] and NAT66 in combination with Unique Local Addresses (ULA).  The IETF consensus to preserve end-to-end connectivity does not favor the general acceptance of these two solutions, yet they are described in sections 5.3 and 5.4 because they offer a degree of support for the requirements listed in section 4.
