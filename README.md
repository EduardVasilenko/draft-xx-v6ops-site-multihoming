# Abstract
Carrier resilience is a typical business requirement.
IPv4 was solving this problem by private internal site addressing in combination with separate NAT engines to redundant carriers.
IPv6 claims support for end-to-end connectivity. Hence, NAT is the least desired option. But other IPv6 solutions for carrier resiliency have challenges.
This document discusses all potential options possible to organize carrier resiliency for a site.
The presented view is the summary of discussions on the v6ops mailing list not a personal opinion of the small group of authors.
