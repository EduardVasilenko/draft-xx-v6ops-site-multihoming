Solution Requirements are reflecting section 3.1 of [multi6] except for “Transport-Layer Survivability” (preservation of the session during the carrier disruption) which is not considered mandatory.
1.	Site resiliency to an arbitrary number of carriers, with an arbitrary number of routers on the link.
2.	End-to-end connectivity wherever possible.
3.	Possibility for internal communication using any prefixes distributed by local routers, irrespective of the status of the connectivity to the carriers that distributed such prefixes.
4.	The speed of convergence for the prefix deprecation on the site after connectivity is lost to any particular carrier should be comparable to the speed of routing convergence on the site. If flash renumbering affects the convergence of a particular solution then such a solution should have mechanisms to guarantee the desired level of convergence performance despite flash renumbering.
5.	Support for sites with complex topologies, including multiple internal on-site hops requiring many routers and links.
6.	Access to resources from the carrier's “subscriber-only services” is permitted only when using the address space distributed by the particular carrier. There may exist a need for the host to check DNS resolvers from all carriers before it can even discover the restricted resource. A given host may thus need to choose the correct source address that would be accepted by the particular carrier.
7.	Possibility for traffic steering between different paths (including both internal to the site, and the Internet) based on bandwidth, cost, load, latency, packet loss, hop count, etc. (e.g. application traffic/path engineering) for both outbound and inbound packets.
It is out of scope for this document to evaluate issues related to perimeter security; every system should assume an insecure environment, which is already the case since the host is establishing frequent connections to the open Internet.
Different environments have diverse security policies, needs, and obligations that may be shaped by internal policy, regulatory compliance, or national security requirements, and as such will not be discussed in detail in this document.
Privacy is furthermore assumed to be protected by [Temporary addressing] and is also kept outside of carrier resiliency design considerations. Address-based privacy considerations are not affected by carrier resiliency mechanisms and techniques.
All solutions to the problem statement in this document would have different cost advantages and disadvantages. The associated costs may greatly vary for different geographies, market segments, and organization sizes, but the choices should be ultimately driven by any needs and requirements set upon the organization by their respective governing bodies, with input from the appropriate subject matter experts.
It is recognized that cost is often a determining factor in IT and networking decisions, but it is also considered out of the scope of this document.
