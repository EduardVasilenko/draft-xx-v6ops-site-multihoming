It is possible to shift the internet resiliency problem to the centralized site of the big enterprise if the branch has a redundant WAN connectivity organized in any other way (SDH/PDH/OTN links, MPLS VPNs, encrypted tunnels). It is typically much easy to arrange the resiliency over internal WAN links with the help of routing.
Unfortunately, the disablement of "local Internet breakout" increases the latency for the users on the branch site. On the positive side, a centralized gateway to the Internet permits improved perimeter security.
Shifting the problem to a different place is not a solution because the other site would be challenged in the same. It would have the same options for multihoming discussed in sections 5.1-5.4.
Enterprise WAN design by itself is out of the scope of this document.
