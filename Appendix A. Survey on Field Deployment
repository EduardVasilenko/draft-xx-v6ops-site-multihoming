A survey was proposed to collect information on multi-homing solutions adopted in field deployment.
As of February 20, 2024, 22 respondents provided answers to the following questions.

Question 1: How many CPEs are connected to ISPs on the average site?
17 responses:
1.1. One CPE: 2 answers (11.8%)
1.2. Two CPEs: 13 answers (76.5%)
1.3. More than two: 2 answers (11.8%)

Question 2: How many uplinks are configured per CPEs/CEs in your average site?
17 responses:
2.1. One (every CPE has just 1 uplink toward a certain ISP): 8 answers (47.1%)
2.2. Two or more (a CPE is connected at least with 2 different ISPs): 9 answers (52.9%)

Question 3: Which configuration do you support?
16 responses:
3.1. Active/active: 13 answers (81.3%)
3.2. Active/standby: 3 answers (18.8%)

Question 4: Do your CPEs/CEs implement VRRP or any other dynamic exchange of redundancy control information?
17 responses:
4.1. Yes: 9 answers (52.9%)
4.2. No: 8 answers (47.1%)

Question 5: If the answer to the previous is “No”, which method do you employ for supporting IPv6 multi-homing?
12 responses:
5.1. PI addressing: 5 answers (41.7%)
5.2. PA addressing (GUA), each ISP assigns a prefix to every CPE/CE: 4 answers (33.3%)
5.3. ULA/GUA intra-site with ALG at the border: 0 answers (0.0%)
5.4. ULA/GUA intra-site with NPTv6 at the border: 1 answer (8.3%)
5.5. ULA/GUA intra-site with NAT66 at the border: 1 answer (8.3%)
5.6. Other: 1 answer (8.3%)

The field "Other" allows one to specify a solution different from the ones previously listed. 
At present, the configurations listed are:
5.6.1 PA addressing (GUA) with an address from CPE. ULA intra-site. NAT66 at the border for mismatches.

Question 6: Which method do you employ for supporting IPv4 multi-homing (if any)?
17 responses:
6.1. Public Addressing: 9 answers (52.9%)
6.2. NAT44: 8 answers (47.1%)
